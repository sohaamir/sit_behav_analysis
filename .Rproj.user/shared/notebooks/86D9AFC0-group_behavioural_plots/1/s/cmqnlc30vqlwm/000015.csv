"2","Note: D.f. calculations have been disabled because the number of observations exceeds 6000.
To enable adjustments, add the argument 'pbkrtest.limit = 7000' (or larger)
[or, globally, 'set emm_options(pbkrtest.limit = 7000)' or larger];
but be warned that this may result in large computation time and memory use.
